        <h4>FRUIT SALAD with a strawberry twist <br/>Posted on June 6, 2022</h4>

        
        <p>The best fruit salads are homemade fruit salads. Sure, you can buy a fruit salad pre-made at the supermarket already chopped and ready-to-go. But I promise you this – if you take just a few minutes to make this recipe at home you’ll be rewarded with a fruit salad tastier than anything you’ve ever bought. The flavor is so much brighter, fresher, juicier, and all around more delicious!</p>
